-- Question 3

-- INNER JOIN

SELECT * 
FROM table_a
INNER JOIN table_b -- can use join instead
ON table_a.id = table_b.id;

-- LEFT OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a
LEFT OUTER JOIN table_b -- can use left join instead
on table_a.id = table_b.id;

-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table_b -- can use right join instead
on table_a.id = table_b.id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a
FULL OUTER JOIN table_b -- -- can use full join instead
on table_a.id = table_b.id;

-- NATURAL JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a
NATURAL JOIN table_b;

-- CROSS JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a
CROSS JOIN table_b;

-- SELF JOIN

SELECT *
FROM table_a as x
JOIN table_a as y
ON x.id = y.id;

-- OR

SELECT *
FROM table_a as x
JOIN table_a as y
USING(id); -- using gets rid of the extra(repeated) column
